            <h2>Kerala, God's Own Country</h2>
            <p id="main_p">Kerala is one of India's most fortunate states and is unquestionably "God's own Country." Kerala is blessed with many enthralling locations, including breathtaking beaches, luscious green paddy fields, funny forts, cool and calming hill stations, attractive shallow lagoons, and amazing flora and fauna, in addition to its distinctive history and magnetic culture. The most astounding thing about these locations is that they are all only 3â€“4 hours apart from one another, which is a very uncommon occurrence. The distinctive culture of Kerala is also evident in its diverse arts, crafts, language, history, festivals, martial arts, clothes, etc. So visit Kerala and experience its beauty.</p>

                    <h3>Silent Valley National Park</h3>
                    <span>You might experience and hear things that you could never have imagined due to the unnerving silence, which is emphasised by the missing Cicadas who gave Silent Valley its name. This reserve of tropical rainforests was peaceful and undisturbed a few centuries ago, before people arrived in the Silent Valley. It was like a perfectly concealed diamond. One would question if this ecosystem has endured since the beginning of time given the vegetation and wildlife found here.</span>

                    <h3>Ponmudi</h3>
                    <span>One of the best things to do in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram, according to locals, is to take a weekend trip to Ponmudi. Families and groups of friends are known to take lengthy journeys up the twisting trails in search of a vista that, in their opinion, is unmatched in the State. One is amazed and filled with wonder by the mist-covered mountains. Here, you can witness a variety of unique plants and animals, such as mountain flowers, wild orchids, and unusual butterflies.</span>
